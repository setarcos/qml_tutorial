# Learn QML
Inspired by the code from [Learn QT 5](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Qt-5), just use the commit log to record what was learned by reading the book.

## Howto build
I like to build the project in a different directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ qmake ../main.pro
    $ make
